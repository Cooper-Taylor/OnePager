                <p class="col-8 offset-2">Cell communication is super cool and can be used for a lot of things within the cell, such as quorum sensing in bacterial cells, which allow them to understand how many cells there are around them. To be able to communicate, cells have many different methods, but the most 'popular' one could say is by using small chemicals that are recieved in receptor proteins.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-8 offset-2">The molecules used to signal are called <p style="font-weight: bold;">ligands</p>! They play an extremely important role in almost every part of the cell, which we will see later on. As this is supposed to be short, and I am tired as it is currently 1:33am and I have been constantly doing homework, just not for myself, I will make this the most succinct review known to man.</p>

                <ol class="col-12">
                    <li>A signaling molecule binding to a specific receptor (reception)</li>
                    <li>Activiation of a signal transduction pathway (transduction)</li>
                    <li>Production of a cellular response (response)</li>

            <div class="row">
                <p class="col-8 offset-2">Signaling will always have to be recieved, but depending on the ligand, it can be recieved differently. For example, if the ligand is nonpolar such as a cholesterol-based steroid or hormones, it can pass through the plasma membrane and meet receptor on the inside. Otherwise, they were be met with a receptor present on the membrane of the cell</p>

                <h3 class="col-12">Three Classes of Membrane Receptors</h3>    
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <ul>
                    <li>Ligand-gated ion channels</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opens up an ion channel when a particular ligand is bound to the receiving protein. A common examle is the sodium-potassium pump for depolarilization of the neurons or muscle cells</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Catalytic</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Basically what this means is that there is an enzyme active site on the pytoplasmic side of the membrane which is activated by a ligand flaoting extracellularly. One great example her would be insulin receptors</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>G-protein Linked Receptors</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>G protein is activated, and then uses GTP or GDP to move, which activates another protein complex, that forms cAMP, or cyclic adenosine mono phosphate. A popular example of this one is epinephrin!</li>
                    </ul>
